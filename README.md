# Data-Analysis-League-of-Legends-Study
During 2 months, I managed to work on a short data project on League of Legends since I am a big fan of the game and its use of data.

## Introduction
1 An Introduction to Data & Analytics in the Gaming Industry
Just as it did with traditional sports, the collection, analysis, and use of all kinds of data is starting
to change the way that competitive games are played and understood. Nowadays, as the E-sports
became more and more popular, data analyses on E-sports games are also become much more
common. Because of the foundations of multiple commercial E-sport Leagues, data analyses is
playing a significant role, just like the role they play in NBA and other sport leagues.
In this project, the online game League of Legends (LoL), developed by Riot Games in 2009, will
be our case study. The main reason is everyone in our group had played and enjoyed the game
and would like to bring a more passionate and informed view to this project than they would with
another case study. An important aspect was also Riot Games’ API, which allows the public to
easily make queries and pull information from their servers. Another great selling point is the
fact that League of Legends is one of the most popular modern day E-sports, meaning its balance
updates affect people’s lives on a professional level.

## Related Work
As League of Legends is a popular game, there are already a couple of applications that exist in
the data analysis sphere. Websites like League of Graphs and MetaSrc collect basic stats and
information from the League of Legends API and use it to construct simple analyses like what
the most popular champion and what the win rate of two champions when played together are.
What these existing applications do not currently do is prediction of a currently ongoing game
with all of the features of that game in mind, and that is the hole that our project is attempting to fill.
